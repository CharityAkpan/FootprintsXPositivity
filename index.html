				<h3>Fate or Happenstance</h3>
				<p>We started out in uni as friends, sharing a bond we couldn’t quite explore yet. The brand <em>Ubokobong Wilson</em>, a.k.a <em>Mr. Positivity</em>, was a force to reckon with—a symbol of excellence then, and still is now. You inspired me back then, and you continue to inspire me today.<br /><br />
				We shared laughter, struggles in aluta, and sometimes fights. Little did we know, this would be the bedrock for something extraordinary.</p>

				<h3>Love Across the Miles</h3>
				<p>Years later, we remained friends—sometimes from a distance, other times closely in the DMs. The connection we built in uni never faded; instead, it grew stronger with time. Distance couldn’t break what we had; it only made us realize how much we truly meant to each other.</p>

				<h3>Then It Began</h3>
				<p>On <strong>December 22, 2024</strong>, our friendship blossomed into something even more beautiful. We took a leap of faith and decided to start a relationship. It didn’t matter that we hadn’t seen each other since uni, or that the miles separated us. You believed we would work, and here we are.<br /><br />
				Our love has only grown stronger with every call, every message, and every shared moment.</p>

										<h6><p>First is the message when you asked me to be you Girl, I'm glad i said Yes. Next is the love letter I recieved on our one month together, it was so sweet, matter of fact, i read it an unhealthy number of times, hahaha. The last is a random chat from our conversations, whenever you say you will love me forever, especially when you say it the way you say, it makes my heart leap. I searched the word love in our chat, and would you believe it appeared over 650 times?? wow! </p></h6>
